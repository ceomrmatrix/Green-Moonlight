# What's New?
Green Moonlight represents a total overhaul of its predecessor, "Syringe." Every line of code has been reimagined to deliver a faster, more stable executor. 

Key highlights of this rewrite include:

Modern Architecture: Built from scratch for improved efficiency and compatibility with the latest Roblox updates.

Enhanced Security: Advanced techniques to bypass Byfron/Hyperion, Roblox’s anti-cheat systems, ensuring uninterrupted script execution.
